## Infrastructure
DrugFax has been containerized using Docker and is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using the Beanstalk/Docker template. 
The creation of necessary infrastructure has been automated by using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). 
The CloudFormation document we used to generate the live infrastructure has been provided in [cloudformation.json](https://github.com/atsid/18f-RFQ993471-POOL2/blob/master/cloudformation.json).
The database instances for the application are hosted in [compose.io](http://compose.io/), which hosted management of MongoDB and other NoSQL databases.

## Monitoring
DrugFax is monitored using NewRelic. NewRelic provides performance and availability monitoring, and can alert us to critical events using a service integration with PagerDuty. If the NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable is set, the application will start up the NewRelic monitor.
 
## Configuration Management
We use [node-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) to manage our application configuration. 
Node-Config allows you to define a default configuration object, and optional overrides per each NODE_ENV environment. 
Additionally, it provides a bridge for environment variables to be injected into the configuration object. 
We use environment variables exclusively to manage sensitive API keys and connection strings.

## Development / CI Practices

![Developer Flow Diagram](./documentation/developer_flow.png)

We used the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) practice of encapsulating changes to the project as pull requests. 
This allows us to have a code review policy before code is merged into the master (stable) branch.  
We use [Wercker](wercker.com) to build the application. 
Successful Wercker builds are saved as new tagged version of the application in our Docker Hub account.
Wercker supports Github Flow and provides build information with every build on every branch, this allows us some level of verification before code is merged into the stable branch.
Wercker, CodeClimate, and Github all emit WebHook events into Slack, which we have utilized as our team communication mechanism.

## Testing
The entire application has been tested using [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), [chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [SuperAgent](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/). 
The client-tests use [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to emulate DOM interactions. 
Unit testing coverage has been reported to [CodeClimate](codeclimate.com), and metrics may be viewable at the CodeClimate badge link at the top of this file.

## Development
### Installation
#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Linux)
    > docker-compose build && docker-compose up
        
#### Using Vagrant (Slower Startup)
    > vagrant plugin install vagrant-docker-compose
    > vagrant up
    
### Opening the Application
* **Linux or Vagrant**: `> open http://localhost:9000/`
* **OSX via Docker Compose**: `> open http://$(boot2docker ip 2>/dev/null):9000`
